# maze3d-webgl
Simple WebGL game made with three.js

# Overview
The aim of the game is to find the way out through the maze. As a nimble blue ball you can bounce through the map 
using arrow keys - but watch out unexpected particle clouds!

# Technical details
The game has been written in JavaScript (with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)) and uses [three.js](http://threejs.org/) library 
to display created world using WebGL. Maze layout is currently fixed, which means that every time you play map remains 
the same.
